# Introduction to Docker for (Data) Scientists

Materials for a Software Carpentry style half-day workshop on Docker. Goal of the workshop is to show (data) scientists the benefits of adopting container technologies such as Docker as part of their development workflow.

# Material to cover

## Installing Docker CE

Requires creating an account on DockerHub. Then downloading the GUI installer for specific OS. 

* https://hub.docker.com/
* Should I encourage installing edge or stable version? I am using edge version and have not had any issues, stable version has a slightly different UI.

## Motivating examples using Jupyter-Stacks and Rocker
Objective is to show learners how I use Docker as part of my develoment workflow to produce reproducible data science pipelines.

## Docker-Compose

### Volumes

### Networks

### Image Registries (DockerHub)

## Repo2Docker

## Running Containers

## Building Images

## How to write a Dockerfile

## Docker cookie-cutter for data-science

Want learners to leave with template engines for Python and R that will allow them to get started with solid project structure.
